A:Hello, Mr. He. It's a pleasure to see you again. 
B:It's my pleasure to see you again, too. Mr. Smith. 
A:I believe you have received our proposal regarding the woolen textile project. I think it's always more convenient to discuss things face to face. 
B:Yes. I hope we can come to an agreement this time. 
A:Me too. But it requires efforts by both sides to accomplish that. 
B:Quite right. Shall we come straight to the point right now? 
A:Fine. I believe you have studied our proposal. Could you let me know how you feel about it invery general terms? 
B:Thank you very much for sending us the proposal. But we think we needed to discuss in greater detail some of the points such as price, the mode of payment, etc. 
A:They are certainly open for discussion. Shall we discuss them one by one, beginning with the price? 
B:I don't have the slightest objection. 
=====================================================================================================
A:I believe we'll win the projects as you will no doubt(adv.) find our price very competitive if you take everything into consideration. 
B:I think it's unwise for you to insist on the original price. To be frank, successful business depends very much on the price. If you hang on to your original offer, we'll have no alternative but to buy from some other supplier. 
A:What do you think is an acceptable price then? 
B:To conclude the deal, you should at least reduce the price by 20%. 
A:20%?It's beyond the limits of what I can discuss. I'm afraid I have to talk to my office first. 
B:Please. We'll wait for your reply.
